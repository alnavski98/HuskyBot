# HuskyBot

HuskyBot is a simple bot written for Aozora's private Discord server. 

It currently does not contain a lot of features, and I doubt it will ever become useful. It is purely made to test
javascript skills in the form of a discord bot.

----------

## Currently supported features
- Auto-response whenever user writes "-ping"
- Can make a simple yes/no poll

----------

## Features to be added
- Display current date and time
- Fetch random inspirational quotes from the web
- Display information about the server
- Coinflip for making easier decisions
- Fetch random pictures of huskies
- Display instructions on how to use commands

## Current commands and auto-responses

- `-ping` Makes the bot respond with "pong"
- `-poll {question}` Creates a poll embed with provided question
